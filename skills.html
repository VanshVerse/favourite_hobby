      <h2>🎯 Life Lessons from the Pitch</h2>
      <p>Cricket has taught me more than just how to bat or bowl. It has helped me grow as a person. Every match, every practice session, and every challenge has shaped my character. These are the skills I’ve gained through my cricket journey:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Teamwork:</strong> Cricket is a team sport. I’ve learned how to support my teammates, communicate clearly, and celebrate each other’s success.</li>
        <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Regular practice, punctuality, and following rules have made me more disciplined in both sports and studies.</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Whether I’m batting or fielding, staying focused is key. This skill helps me concentrate better in class too.</li>
        <li><strong>Leadership:</strong> Leading my team in friendly matches taught me how to make decisions, motivate others, and stay calm under pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Fitness:</strong> Cricket keeps me active and healthy. Running, catching, and fielding have improved my stamina and strength.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>🧠 Cricket Beyond the Field</h2>
      <p>These skills are not just for the cricket ground—they help me in real life too. Whether it’s a group project in school or preparing for exams, I use the same focus, teamwork, and discipline I’ve learned from cricket.</p>
      <p>Cricket has made me more confident, responsible, and positive. Jab bhi mushkil waqt aata hai, I remind myself: “Stay calm, play your game, and never give up.”</p>
