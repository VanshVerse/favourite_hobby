      <h2>🎯 Why Cricket is my Favourite Hobby</h2>
      <p>Cricket is more than just a sport to me—it's a way of life. From the sound of the bat hitting the ball to the thrill of taking a wicket, every moment on the field fills me with joy. I started playing cricket when I was in Class 6, and since then, it has become my weekend ritual. Whether it's a friendly match with friends or cheering for Team India on TV, cricket is always close to my heart.</p>
      <p>Playing cricket has taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to stay calm under pressure. It keeps me physically fit and mentally sharp. I love the strategy behind every over, the excitement of a close match, and the celebration of every boundary and wicket. Cricket is not just a game—it's my passion, my escape, and my dream.</p>
