      <h2>🏏 The Origins of Cricket</h2>
      <p>Cricket was born in the fields of England during the 16th century. It started as a simple bat-and-ball game played by children and farmers. Over time, it evolved into a structured sport with rules, teams, and tournaments. By the 18th century, cricket had become England’s national sport.</p>
      <p>British colonizers introduced cricket to many countries, including India, Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies. Today, cricket is one of the most popular sports in the world, with millions of fans and players across continents.</p>
