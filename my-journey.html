      <h2>🏏 How It All Started</h2>
      <h3><p>I still remember the first time I held a cricket bat. It was during a school break in Class 6, and I joined a friendly match with my classmates. That moment changed everything. I felt the thrill of hitting the ball, running between the wickets, and cheering with my team. Since then, cricket has become a part of my daily life.</p>
      <p>Every Sunday, I play matches with my friends in the local ground.
         We form teams, set rules, and play with full energy. Sometimes we win,
          sometimes we lose—but the fun never stops. Cricket has taught me how to 
          stay focused, how to support my teammates, and how to enjoy every moment on the field.</p></h3>

      <h2>🏅 Achievements and Memories</h2>
     <h3> <p>Last year, I was selected for my school’s cricket team. I played as a fielder and took some amazing catches. During the annual sports meet, I won the “Best Fielder” award. That moment was unforgettable—mera sapna sach ho gaya!</p>
      <p>My family and friends always support me. They cheer for me 
        during matches and encourage me to keep practicing. I dream
         of playing at a professional level one day. Cricket is not
          just a hobby—it’s my passion, my goal, and my identity.</p></h3>
